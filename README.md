## Task

Your group has been headhunted by a web development agency looking for fresh talent to help their customers fullfill their needs via projects. To make sure that you got what they are looking for, they have asked you to develop an application that are to be reviewed. The scale and complexityt of the application is up to you, but the company would like you to at least prove your worth in asyncronous programming by fetching and using data from a REST-API.

API used:

### REST Countries API

```
https://restcountries.com/
```

## Instructions

You will have one afternoon day 1 to make decisions, test API, plan, sketch, and if you find time start coding.
Then you will have all of day 2 to code your application and before the end of the day you must send your repositories to me.
On day 3 you will get another project on your hands that you are to review, and then present.

### Presentation

I want a full presentation of the reviewed application, including at least 2 things that you would have done differently, and 2 things that you think was very well done. Presentation should include both code review and a demonstration of the application.
